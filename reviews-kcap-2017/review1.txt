Year's after the failed attempt in semantic Web services, there are new approaches and solutions emerging that aim in solving fundamentally the same problem, but with more lightweight technology and, crucially, with the support of ontologies that are now actually used/available on the Web (e.g. schema.org). This paper explores techniques to represent parameterized response structure of RESTful services in an expressive way and compares custom types, SHACL, SPIN, and OWL with each other. It concludes that there is no clear winner, but SHACL and SPIN are clearly the better choices for most applications. Overall, the paper is complete in its analysis (although the idea of reusable mappers/choreographies in the redundant WSMO/WSML/WSMX ontology framework could have been applied to SPIN, i.e. mitigating its disadvantage of verbosity by reusing SPIN templates) and should be a good discussion point at the conference.
