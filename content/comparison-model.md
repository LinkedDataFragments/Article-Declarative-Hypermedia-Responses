## Model for Comparison
{:#comparison-model}

In this section, we introduce a simple model for comparing approaches for declaratively representing Web API responses.
Our model consists of different criteria that can influence the choice of a certain approach:
_RDF complexity_, _expressivity_, _composability_, _discoverability_ and _adoptability_.
These will be explained hereafter.
Each response representation approach can receive a qualitative score for each of these criteria.
A suitable approach can then be chosen based on the composite score across these criteria,
which can possibly be weighted depending on the relative importance of these criteria in the use case.

### RDF Complexity

The level of RDF complexity, i.e., how 'deep' the response structure is represented in RDF,
has an influence on how easily such a representation can be used by RDF-based tools.

A SPARQL query could for example be represented as an RDF string literal,
or fully reified using the SPIN vocabulary.
Both approaches have the same meaning, but the former representation requires less effort to represent in RDF,
while the latter provides better compatibility with RDF-based tools, such as reasoners and query engines.
If a subset of such a SPARQL query needs to be taken, an RDF reasoner or query engine
can more easily do this using the reified RDF representation than the string literal.

### Expressivity

Vocabularies for declaring response types can exist at different levels of expressivity.
One vocabulary may only enable simple triple pattern queries to be represented,
which may be simple for a client to parse and handle, but is not very expressive.
Another vocabulary may enable full SPARQL queries to be represented,
which may be more complex for a client to use, but is much more expressive.

According to the REST principles, clients should require no prior knowledge
about interface functionality except for the agreed-upon primitives.
These primitives should be as simple as possible,
to lower the barrier for clients to support these primitives,
such as the eight well known [HTTP](cite:citesAsAuthority http) methods.
If a server exposes certain specific functionality,
clients should be able to interpret and make use of this specific functionality without requiring explicit implementation of it.
Therefore, the approach should be as expressive as possible.

Higher expressivity does however typically lead to higher complexity for client-side parsing and usage,
but also for server-side declaration generation if this would happen dynamically at runtime.
Expressivity and simplicity of usage are contradicting criteria, so a trade-off between these two must be sought out.
The Assembly language is for example very expressive, but its low level of abstraction would make it complex to use.

### Composability

Just like a [feature-based interface](cite:citesAsAuthority webapifeatures),
response structures could be made up of multiple smaller reusable components that can be _composed_ and _extended_.
This allows clients to only be required to understand these smaller components,
and this could allow more complex composed response types to be interpreted automatically.
Different techniques can lead to different levels of composability.

A certain Web API could for example return a list of people based on a certain query.
Another similar Web API could annotate all these people with their place of birth,
which can be seen as an _extension_ to the first API,
or a _composition_ of the 'query' feature and the 'annotation' feature.
Another composition could for example apply some kind of _sorting_ or _filtering_ feature,
possibly based on certain parameters.

### Discoverability

Certain techniques for declaring response structure are more easily _discoverable_ than others,
meaning that based on the technique,
clients may require more or less effort for _finding_ and _interpreting_ the response structure.
A single text-based identifier for a reponse structure could for example be very simple for clients to detect,
while a reference to the source code that is used to control the Web API requires much more effort from the client.

### Adoptability

While different approaches for Web API response types exist,
the used technologies behind these approaches will have an impact on the adoption rate.
The usage of a new, unknown and non-standard vocabulary will most likely lead to a lower adoption rate
than the usage of vocabulary that is recommended by W3C.
