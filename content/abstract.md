## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
The Web is the main driver of the exchange of information.
While humans browse the Web by following links,
hypermedia is the equivalent that machines for browsing.
While efforts such as Hydra exist for semantically describing hypermedia controls,
they are limited to describing the input parameters to interfaces.
<!-- Need         -->
In order to make it possible for clients to autonomously detect what responses certain interfaces
can return based on certain parameters.
These interfaces need to declaratively define what the response structure
for certain controls is in terms of certain parameters.
<!-- Task         -->
For this, a vocabulary is needed to represent this parameterized response structure
in a generic, but expressive way.
<!-- Object       -->
In this work, we discuss three different approaches for declaring such response structure,
and we compare them based on a simple model that we introduce.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
Based on this model, we conclude that a SHACL shape-based approach
is sufficient for declaring such a parameterized response structure.
