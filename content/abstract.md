## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
While humans browse the Web by following links,
hypermedia is the equivalent that machines use for browsing.
While efforts such as Hydra exist for semantically describing hypermedia controls,
they are limited to describing the input parameters to interfaces,
and clients therefore do not know what response to expect these interfaces.
<!-- Need         -->
As such, interfaces need to declaratively describe the response structure
of their parameterized controls.
<!-- Task         -->
For this, a vocabulary is needed to represent this parameterized response structure
in a generic, but expressive way.
<!-- Object       -->
In this work, we discuss three different approaches for declaring such response structure,
and we compare them based on a simple model that we introduce.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
Based on this model, we conclude that a SHACL shape-based approach
is sufficient for declaring such a parameterized response structure.
