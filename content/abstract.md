## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
While humans browse the Web by following links,
hypermedia is the equivalent that machines use for browsing.
While efforts such as Hydra exist for semantically describing
the hypermedia controls on Web interfaces
to enable smarter interface-agnostic clients,
they are limited to describing the input parameters to interfaces,
and clients therefore do not know what response to expect from these interfaces.
<!-- Need         -->
As such, interfaces need to declaratively describe the response structure
of their parameterized controls.
<!-- Task         -->
For this, a technique is needed to represent this parameterized response structure
in a generic, but expressive way.
<!-- Object       -->
In this work, we discuss four different approaches for declaring such response structure,
and we compare them based on a simple model that we introduce.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
Based on this model, we conclude that a SHACL shape-based approach
is the most for declaring such a parameterized response structure,
as it conforms to the REST architectural style that has helped shaping the Web to its current form.
