## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
While humans browse the Web by following links,
these _hypermedia_ links can also be used by machines for browsing.
While efforts such as Hydra semantically describe
the hypermedia controls on Web interfaces
to enable smarter interface-agnostic clients,
they are largely limited to the input parameters to interfaces,
and clients therefore do not know what response to expect from these interfaces.
<!-- Need         -->
In order to convey such expectations,
interfaces need to declaratively describe the response structure
of their parameterized hypermedia controls.
<!-- Task         -->
We therefore explored techniques to represent this parameterized response structure
in a generic but expressive way.
<!-- Object       -->
In this work, we discuss four different approaches for declaring aÂ response structure,
and we compare them based on a model that we introduce.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
Based on this model, we conclude that a SHACL shape-based approach
can be used for declaring such a parameterized response structure,
as it conforms to the REST architectural style that has helped shape the Web into its current form.
