## Response Declaration Approaches
{:#approaches}

In this section, we discuss and compare different approaches
for declaratively describing the responses of Web APIs based on given parameters.
We will use the TPF use case as a running example.
For this, we will extend from the hypermedia control from [](#tpf-controls),
which currently describes the interface input parameters,
to describe the responses to triple pattern queries.

We categorize our three categories,
which will be explained hereafter:
Custom types, SHACL shapes, and SPIN SPARQL queries.

### Custom Types

A simple solution would be to define a new response type at vocabulary-level
for each hypermedia control type that exists.
For our use case, we could introduce a `tpf:TriplePatternQueryResponse` type in a new `tpf` vocabulary,
which refers to a triple pattern query, as shown in [](#approach-customtypes).

While this approach may seem very simple to setup at first sight,
it has some significant disadvantages.
For one, as each response type requires a separate RDF type,
clients implement have explicit support for each of these potentially huge number of types.
Instead of small functional building blocks that can be reused,
service providers would have to define new types for each interface that offers different functionality.

### SHACL Shapes

The recent [SHACL](cite:citesAsAuthority spec:shacl) W3C recommendation allows
RDF shapes to be defined for constraint checking and validation.
Instead of validating shapes, we can also use SHACL to describe the shape of our responses.

In our TPF use case, we could make our search form a parameterizable shape,
and declare the triple pattern query as a [SPARQL](cite:citesAsAuthority spec:sparqllang) SELECT query,
as shown in [](#approach-shacl).

<figcaption markdown="block">

that is a subclass of `sh:Parameterizable` and `sh:SPARQLSelectExecutable`.
</figcaption>
</figure>

The interface input parameters and the response shape parameters are declared separately.
The former is defined using Hydra, while the latter is defined using SHACL.
As these parameters are — and should always be — equal for allowing output to be fully defined using input,
one of the two methods could be deprecated in favor of the other.
The Hydra variables are simpler, but also less expressive.
SHACL parameters are much more expressive because they are also SHACL property shapes,
which means that the full expressivity of SHACL constraints can be used on these parameter values.

SHACL parameter names are however not defined in the same way as Hydra variable names.
Hydra allows variable names to be set using the `hydra:variable` predicate.
Instead, SHACL parameter names are derived from the IRI in `sh:path`.

In summary, SHACL shapes are very expressive for declaring responses of Web APIs.
Furthermore, the expressivity from the SPARQL query language and JavaScript are inherited thanks to
the SHACL extensions [SHACL-SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-shacl-20170720/#sparql-constraints){:.mandatory}
and [SHACL-JS](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-shacl-js-20170608/){:.mandatory}.

### SPIN SPARQL Queries

The [SPIN vocabulary](cite:citesAsAuthority spec:spin) can be seen as the predecessor
to SHACL for specifying rules and constraints.
It is more lightweight than SHACL, but thereby also less expressive.
The SPIN vocabulary is based on the SPARQL query language for defining these constraints.

SPIN allows SPARQL queries to be defined in a triple representation,
something which SHACL does not support.
The advantage of triple-based representations over text-based is that RDF-based tools
can directly use and work with these structures, such as reasoners and query engines.
The disadvantage of triple-based representations is that they are typically
more verbose than their text-based variant.

As our TPF use case requires the representation of a triple pattern query,
we can again trivially represent this as a SPARQL SELECT query using SPIN,
as shown in [](#approach-spin).

<figure id="approach-spin" class="listing">
````/code/approach-spin.txt````
<figcaption markdown="block">

</figure>

As mentioned before, the SPIN-based query in [](#approach-spin) is indeed
more verbose than the SHACL-SPARQL SELECT query from [](#approach-shacl).
That is because SPIN requires a reified representation of triple patterns,
which leads to a large amount of triples, even for simple queries.

As our subject, predicate and object variables are now represented as actual resources,
they are explicitly linked with the Hydra variables, which is a semantic advantage.
