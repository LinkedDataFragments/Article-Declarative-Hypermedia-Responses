## Approaches
{:#approaches}

In this section, we discuss and compare different approaches
for declaratively describing the responses of Web APIs based on given parameters.
We will use the TPF use case as a running example.
For this, we will extend from the hypermedia control from [](#tpf-controls),
which currently describes the interface input parameters,
to describe the responses to triple pattern queries.

We categorize our four categories,
which will be explained hereafter:
Custom types, SHACL shapes, OWL restrictions, and SPARQL query mapping.

### Custom Types

### SHACL Shapes

### OWL Restrictions

### SPARQL Query Mapping
